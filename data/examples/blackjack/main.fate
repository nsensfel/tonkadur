Welcome to Tonkadur's wonderful and totally original blackjack!
Say, I don't think I've seen you before...
No, no, I am sure I haven't, actually.
(prompt_string (ptr player.name) 1 64 What's your name, then?)
Alright, (var player.name), well, since it's your first time here, let me give
you some coins.
Just between you and me, someone left those laying around, they aren't mine.

(visit money_acquisition (+ 100 (rand 0 100)))
(set original_amount (var player.money))

Now, you're all set to go... unless you don't know how to play?

      Outch. I suppose all your luck was spent by getting these free coins.
   )
   (
      (< player.money original_amount)
      Well, that's not too bad for your first time. Come back tomorrow, I am
      sure you'll be getting it all back.
   )

      (< player.money (* original_amount 2))
      Had a good day, I hope?

      Well! That was some fine play, if I do say so myself!

      (var player.name)! How did you do that?! You have to teach me! I did give
      you the tools of your success, so please?

   You walk out, having turned (eval coins_word (var original_amount)) into
